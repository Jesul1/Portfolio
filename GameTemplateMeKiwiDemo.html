    <h1>MeKiwi Demo</h1>
    <div class="divaider"></div>
    <p style="font-size: 22px;"> This game was developed during my trainee period at MeKiwi, Finland's largest VR game developer. The project's goal was to explore new mechanics for future games. I started working on the game solo but was later joined by two classmates.
        <br><br>
        Some of the key features I implemented include gun mechanics, hand and climbing physics, slicing objects, slowing time, and more. This project quickly became a passion for meâ€”I often worked on it during my free time, sometimes putting in 16-hour days to bring these ideas to life.
        <br><br>
        Two standout features were the slicing system, something rarely seen in VR games, and the physics-based player movement and climbing, which required me to design a completely new system for handling player movement. I've documented this in detail [here].
        <br><br>
        Through this project, I gained valuable experience in VR development, understanding what works well in the medium, as well as improving my skills in source control and teamwork.
