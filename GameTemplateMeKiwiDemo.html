    <h1>MeKiwi Demo</h1>
    <div class="divaider"></div>
    <p style="font-size: 22px;"> this game was made when i was a trainee at MeKiwi, witch is finland's biggest vr game developer. The goal of the project was to find new fun mechanics to 
        impliment and work on for future games. I originally started working on the game alone but i was later joined by 2 of my classmates. <br><br> I have made an entire time-line for everything i did for this project
        but some of the things i made include, guns, hand physics, climbing physics, sliceing objects, slowing down time and way more fun stuff.. <br><br>
        this demo definetly turned into a passion prjoect for me and i started working on it on my free time and doing up to 16h work days. i found a lot of the mechanics to be so cool that i really wanted to see them become a reality. <br><br>
        Two of the high lights in this projcet definetly where the slicing system witch is something i have never seen in a VR game and the physics based player movement and climbing witch required me to make a completly new way to handle player movement. 
        i have written a document about it here. 
    
        From this project i learned a lot about VR development and what is and isn't suitable for a vr game. 
        i also learned a lot about source control and team work.
